# TaskManager

This project allows users to build a kanban board together with a team. Changes made by one user are reflected in real-time to other users in the same team based on RXJS. Tasks can be organized into sprints and progress can be tracked with a burn down chart. The data was stored in FireStore from FireBase providing us with observables for asynchronous programming and subscription logic
